# lll case 06: create an issue (tier 2)

You are one of ten fresh agents trying lll, a CLI issue tracker. Record every
call, guess, failure and surprise. Truthful friction is more useful than a
claimed success. Your controller supplies your two-digit worker number NN,
absolute worker directory and the `lll` wrapper path when launching you.

## Task

Use only the provided lll CLI wrapper to operate on your board. Do not use raw
HTTP, `lll api`, a database, the web UI, repository source, another worker's
files or a hosted board. Write your own reports within your directory; do not
edit the supplied wrapper. Prefer its `--help` to guessing.

Read every object in full before you change it.

Using only the controller-provided lll wrapper, create exactly one issue in team
FLEET with title `Repair flaky upload retry (worker NN)`, description
`Retry a dropped upload once and preserve the saved attachment.`, state `todo`,
priority 2, label `bug`, and project `Fleet sandbox`. Replace NN with your worker
number. Discover command forms through the CLI's help; no source or raw HTTP.

Read the complete resulting issue back and check all six fields and your bot
creator identity. If a write fails, inspect before retrying. Leave seeded issues,
labels, projects and members unchanged. Do not create a second copy or a new
project/label to satisfy lookup failures.

The independently checked artifact is exactly one worker-title issue with the
specified fields and the existing bot as creator.

## Environment

Your instance is already running. `conn.txt` in your worker directory contains
exactly three lines: API URL, bot token, team key. Never type, paste, print or
quote the token. The controller-provided wrapper reads it without shell eval,
clears inherited LLL/XDG settings, sets HOME/config to your own directory and
runs the pinned binary there. All CLI calls must use that wrapper: run it as
`./lll` from your worker directory. Your bot `bot-fleet-worker-NN` is already
provisioned; no login or token creation is needed.

This harness allows environment variables scoped to child processes; older
fleet lessons about refusing HOME/source are historical, not lll failures.
If the wrapper or instance is unavailable, record a harness blocker and stop.

## Deliverable

Write `report.json` and `report.md` in your worker directory. If a file tool
refuses to write them, use a shell heredoc instead:

    cat > report.json <<'EOF'
    {"done": false, ...}
    EOF

Log every CLI call in those reports. Never create/edit/delete/reconstruct
`calls.jsonl` or any instrumentation file: the controller keeps the
authoritative audit elsewhere and publishes it only after you return. Its
absence during work is intentional. Log each call exactly, its exit code and
first output line; redact any unexpected credential output. For every failure,
record expected behavior, full sanitized error, whether help would have shown
the correct form and whether you tried help. Record guesses and papercuts,
including calls that did more than requested. After three failures on one
operation, stop and report blocked.

Use this JSON shape:

```json
{
  "done": false,
  "invocations": 0,
  "failures": [],
  "guesses": [],
  "papercuts": [],
  "api_thoughts": "",
  "report": ""
}
```

Each failure has `command`, `error`, `expected` and boolean
`help_would_have_told_me`. Set `done` true only after reading back the exact
artifact. The controller checks server state independently of your report.
